Portfolio Project

The purpose of this homework assignment was for us to create a responsive portfolio for ourselves using bootstrap elements.
The application is supposed to contain a Bio page which contains a short bio abd an image. I also opted to add the links to my social
on this page. The next page was the portfolio which was supposed to contain content that is relevant to projects that we have worked on.
Since our portfolios is empty at this time I opted to put a filler image across this page. The final page was a contact page where the user submitted their information so you could contact them. It was also a requirement that each page had a consistant navbar that linked
to the other pages. I used bootstrap grid elements to ensure that my application worked for all different screen sizes. I also used bootstrap templates for the navbar, input form and card.
